## Making New Entries

The list is built on entries so we love getting suggestions for the best.

### Choosing the entry

- Ask yourself: is this really a great example or resource for local-first? If so, we want it!

### Formatting the entry:

- Each entry should follow the format: `[Title in Title Case](link) - Description`.
- Add new entries at the bottom of the relevant section.
- Maintain concise, accurate descriptions without Local-First mentions or ambiguous language.
- Start descriptions with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Avoid starting descriptions with A or An.
- Double-check spelling and grammar before submitting.

### Making the pull request:

- Give the Pull Request the name: `Add [Title of Entry in Title Case]`
- Do not open Draft / WIP pull requests; ensure it's fully ready and compliant.
- If you're submitting something you have made, wait at least 30 days after creation before submitting it.
- Make separate pull requests for each addition.

We appreciate your suggestions!
